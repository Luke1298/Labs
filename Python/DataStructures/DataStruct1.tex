\objective{Empower students with basic knowledge of the fundamental, canonical data structures in order to understand performance and runtime characteristics.}

Both storing and retrieving data take time. As a data set grows, so too does the time required to manipulate it. 
The overhead associated with working with large data sets makes it crucial that we have a fundamental knowledge of the data structures used to store them.
As we understand the characteristics of such data structures, we will be able to choose the data structure that will help us most efficiently access the data that we need.

\section*{Abstract Data Types}
The fundamental way to store data is via \emph{primitive data types}.
We are actually already quite familiar with these data types: booleans, strings, floats, and integers.
Most information that we care to store is in one of these forms; however, these primitive types can quickly become unwieldy for storing large amounts of information, especially since we rarely want to store a single string, float or integer. Rather, we want to organize our data in different ways depending on what we intend to do with it.
We can do this by using primitive data types, along with arrays, as our building blocks.
More complex data structures are called \emph{abstract data types}.
Python possesses a couple of the more common abstract data types, including dictionaries and sets.
However, the performance of each abstract data type slows down as the size of the data structure increases.
This is why it is so important that we understand the underlying advantages and disadvantages of these structures; such an understanding allows us to choose the most optimal structure for our purposes.

Most abstract data types use an object called a \emph{node} to store data.
A node essentially acts as a box in which we store an arbitrary piece of data.
It usually serves as a building block for whichever kind of data structure we want to create; it is whatever we want it to be and it contains whatever we need it to contain.
This versatility lets us to define nodes to store absolutely anything; what they contain both depends on the data structure itself and data that is actually being stored.
Using nodes allows us to store extra information pertinent to the functioning of the datastructure.
For example, the node of a binary search tree (which we will later discuss in section \ref{Binary Search Tree}) contains three things: a piece of data, a reference to its left child, and a reference to its right child.
The node of a singly linked list contains only two things: a piece of data and a reference to the next node in the list.

\section*{Linked Lists}
\emph{Linked lists} are one of the most simple of all abstract data structures.
A linked list, in essence, is simply a list of nodes that are linked together.
There are two main types of linked lists: singly-linked (figure \ref{fig:singly_linked} and doubly-linked (figure \ref{fig:doubly_linked}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}[->,>=stealth',shorten >=1pt,auto, node distance=1.5cm,thick,main node/.style={rectangle,draw}, minimum size=.5cm]
\tikzset{rect node/.style={rectangle, draw, minimum height = .5cm, minimum width=.2cm}}
  \node[main node] (1) {B};
  \node[main node] (2) [right of=1] {F};
  \node[main node] (3) [right of=2] {G};
  \node[main node] (4) [right of=3] {C};
  \node[draw = none, black!20!blue, node distance=1.5cm] [above left of=1](H) {Head};
\foreach \r in {1, 2, 3, 4}{
  \node[rect node][right of=\r, node distance = .36cm]{};}
\node[draw = none, node distance = 1.5cm] [right of=4]{};  % Centralize this particular figure
\foreach \s/\t  in {1/2, 2/3, 3/4}{
	\path[draw](\s) edge[shorten <=.1cm](\t);}
  \draw[black!20!blue] (H) edge (1.north);
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Singly-linked List}
\label{fig:singly_linked}
\end{figure}

A singly-linked node stores a piece of data (its value), and a single reference that points to the next node in the list.
We begin to implement a singly-linked node class as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}
class Node(object):
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.next = None
        self.value = data
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}[->,>=stealth',shorten >=1pt,auto, node distance=1.5cm, thick,main node/.style={rectangle,draw}, minimum size=.5cm]
\tikzset{rect node/.style={rectangle, draw, minimum height = .5cm, minimum width=.9cm}}
  \node[main node] (1) {B};
  \node[main node] (2) [right of=1] {F};
  \node[main node] (3) [right of=2] {G};
  \node[main node] (4) [right of=3] {C};
  \node[draw = none, black!20!blue, node distance = 1.5cm] [above right of=4] (T) {Tail};
  \node[draw = none, black!20!blue, node distance = 1.5cm] [above left of=1] (H) {Head};
  \node[rect node](1.5)[]{};
  \node[rect node](2.5)[right of=1.5]{};
  \node[rect node](3.5)[right of=2.5]{};
  \node[rect node](4.5)[right of=3.5]{};

\foreach \s/\t  in {1/2, 2/3, 2/1, 3/2, 3/4, 4/3}{
	\path[draw](\s) edge[shorten <=.1cm, shorten >=.1cm](\t);}	
  \draw[black!20!blue] (H) edge (1.north);
  \draw[black!20!blue] (T) edge (4.north);
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Doubly-linked List}
\label{fig:doubly_linked}
\end{figure}

Doubly-linked nodes have two references: one that points to the previous node and one that points to the next node in the list.
This allows for a doubly-linked list to be traversed in both directions, whereas a singly-linked list can only be traversed in one direction.
We modify our node, then, to allow for a reference to the previous node.
\begin{lstlisting}
class Node(object):
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.next = None
        self.previous = None
        self.value = data
\end{lstlisting}

We begin constructing a singly-linked list class with a reference to the head node:
\begin{lstlisting}
class SLinkedList(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
\end{lstlisting}

Linked lists may also have a reference to the tail node and a size counter to keep track of the size of the list.
Including a tail reference allows us to avoid traversing the entire list each time we wish to insert at the end.
Similarly, without a size counter we would have to recount the list every time we wanted to know its size.
\begin{lstlisting}
class SLinkedList(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
        self.tail = None
        self.size = 0
    
    def __len__(self):
        return self.size
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection*{Searching, Inserting and Removing}
To locate a node, our linked must start at the head of the list and follow references to other nodes until the desired node is found.
In a singly-linked list, it is also often a good idea to track the node prior to our index; this will prove useful for our insertion and removal methods. 
We add a find method to our \li{SLinkedList} class:
\begin{lstlisting}
# Returns the node at the given index and the node previous to it.
def find(self, index):
    if index >= len(self):
        raise IndexError

    nfind = self.head
    nprev = None
    # Keeps track of the index of nfind.
    count = 0

    # Update nprev and nfind until we reach the node at the index desired.
    # nfind.next evaluates to True while nfind.next != None
    while count < index and nfind.next:
        count += 1
        nprev = nfind
        nfind = nfind.next
    return nprev, nfind
\end{lstlisting}

In order to insert or delete nodes found in the middle of the list, then, we must first locate the correct node by traversing the list, starting at the head and visiting each node.
Insertion itself is a very efficient procedure, but traversing the list to find the insert location takes longer as the size of the list grows. 
However, because we already have head and tail references, nodes can be inserted or removed from either end of a linked list very efficiently, regardless of the size of the list.

When inserting into a list, we must remember to update the all the appropriate references.
To insert into a linked list, we consider three cases: head insertion, tail insertion, and middle insertion. 
\begin{lstlisting}
def insert(self, index, data):
    if index > len(self):
        raise IndexError
        
    # Initialize a temporary node to store the desired piece of data.
    n = Node(data)
    
    if index == 0:
        # Inserting at the head
        # Assign old head node as n.next
        n.next = self.head
        # Set n as the new head node
        self.head = n
        
        # If n is the only node, set as the tail also
        if len(self) == 0:
            self.tail = self.head
    elif index == len(self):
        # Inserting at the tail
        self.tail.next = n
        # Set n as the new tail
        self.tail = n
    else: 
        # Middle insertion
        nprev, nindex = self.find(index)
        n.next = nindex
        nprev.next = n
    self.size += 1
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{problem}
Removing a node is similar to inserting a node, we must consider removing from the head, tail, or middle of the list.
Implement a \li{remove(self, index)} method in your \li{SLinkedList} class.
Be sure to update your size and references appropriately as you compensate for all possible situations (the index corresponds to a list with a single node, the index is out of range, etc.)

The code below provides a few additional methods to supplement your \li{SLinkedList} class: one that will clear the list and one that will represent the list as a string.
These functions may be useful for testing your removal method.
\begin{lstlisting}
def clear(self):
    self.head = None

def __str__(self):
    return '[' + ','.join(map(str, iter(self)) + ']'
    
def __iter__(self):
    temp = self.head
    while temp:
        yield temp.value
        temp = temp.right
\end{lstlisting}
\emph{Note}: Because Python is able to keep track of the variables we use, it will automatically delete a variable if there is no access to it.
In our \li{clear} method, this property allows us to set the reference to the head to be \li{None} which, in turn, allows Python to clean up the leftover nodes (in other languages, this might cause serious memory leaks).
\label{prob:LinkedList}
\end{problem}

\section*{Stacks, Queues, and Deques}
Stacks, queues (pronounced `cues'), and deques (pronounced `decks') can be thought of as types of linked lists where access is restricted.
Rather than accessing data anywhere in the list, we only add and remove from certain areas, which means that the methods of these structures operate independent of the list size.

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Stacks}: These are built on the `last in, first out' principle, meaning that the last item that was put in the stack will be the first one to leave.
You can imagine this as a pile of plates in the kitchen cupboard.
This means that the last plate put in will be the first one taken out.
To implement this, we would only insert and remove from the same end of a linked list.
\item \emph{Queues}: Queues use a `first in, first out' implementation, meaning that the first thing put in will be the first thing taken out.
This is similar to people waiting in line.
The first person in line will be the first served and taken out of the line.
This is implemented as a linked list where we insert on one end and remove on the opposite end.
\item \emph{Deques}: This structure is a double-ended queue; we can insert and remove from either end of a deque.
Really the only difference between this and a linked list is that we cannot add and remove from the middle.
Python's collections module already contains a deque object, which is discussed on page \pageref{deques} of our initial lab, \nameref{lab:Standard Library}.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Trees}
\label{Binary Search Tree}
Donald Knuth, author of \emph{The Art of Computer Programming}, once said that ``Trees sprout up just about everywhere in computer science.''
We can create many different types of trees by the way we organize the nodes within them.
One of the simplest of these trees is called a \emph{binary search tree}(BST).

A binary search tree is a tree that has a root node with a maximum of two children, commonly referred to as a left child and a right child.
They are commonly ordered such that the left child of the root node contains elements less than the root, and the right child contains elements greater than the root.
The tree is a recursive structure, where each child node is potentially the root of a subtree with the same properties.
This type of organization substantially reduces search time, making trees an excellent data structure to use when our primary goal is efficient searching.
By simply knowing that our target element is less than or greater than the root, we can immediately eliminate half of the binary tree from the search.
Because the process of locating a node is so quick, the processes of inserting and removing nodes are similarly efficient.

We begin building a BST by defining our node class. 
A node in a binary search tree holds a piece of data as well as references to its left and right children which can, in turn, be the roots of subtrees.
We call a node without any children a \emph{leaf} node.
\begin{lstlisting}
class Node(object):
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.value = data
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
\end{lstlisting}
We initialize our BST similarly to a linked list, with a reference to the root and to a size counter to keep track of the size.
\begin{lstlisting}
class BinarySearchTree(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = None
        self.size = 0
        
    def __len__(self):
        return self.size
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection*{Inserting}
Inserting a node into a binary search tree is a simple procedure.
Our goal is to insert into a leaf node, so we travel to the right if the element is greater than the current node or travel to the left if the element is less than the current node.
Once we reach a node without a subtree in the appropriate location, we add our new node as its new child node.
This way, we insert only leaf nodes into a BST.

Let's demonstrate this process with an example.

\begin{minipage}{0.35\textwidth}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[thick]
      \node[circle, draw, minimum size = 1cm]{23};
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{minipage}\hfill
\begin{minipage}{0.55\textwidth}
    We start with an empty tree, and add our root node: $23$.
\end{minipage}

\begin{minipage}{0.35\textwidth}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[
      node distance = 1.5cm,
      level distance=1.5 cm,
      level 1/.style={sibling distance=3cm},
      level 2/.style={sibling distance=1.5cm},
      thick, minimum size=1cm]
      \node[circle,draw](23) {23}
	    child {
	    node [circle,draw](17){17}
	    }
	    child{node[circle,draw](476){476}
	    };
      \path[->, >=stealth', shorten >=1pt, auto]
	    (23) edge[bend right, blue] (17)
	    (23) edge[bend left, red] (476);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{minipage}\hfill
\begin{minipage}{0.55\textwidth}
    Now we add two children: $17$ and $476$.
    Clearly, $17$ becomes the left child because $17 < 23$, and $476$ becomes the right child because $476 > 23$.
\end{minipage}

\begin{minipage}{0.35\textwidth}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[
      node distance = 1.5cm,
      level distance=1.5 cm,
      level 1/.style={sibling distance=3cm},
      level 2/.style={sibling distance=1.5cm},
      thick, minimum size=1cm]
      \node[circle,draw] {23}
	    child {
	    node [circle,draw]{17}
	    }
	    child{node[circle,draw]{476}
		    child{node[circle,draw](28){28}}
		    child[fill=none] {edge from parent[draw=none]}
	    };
      \path[->, >=stealth', shorten >=1pt, auto]
      (23) edge[bend left, red] (476)
      (476) edge [bend right, blue] (28);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{minipage}\hfill
\begin{minipage}{0.55\textwidth}
    What happens if we add $28$? Starting at the root, we move to the right because $28 > 23$.
    However, there is already a right subroot there!
    $28$ must then take $476$ as its parent node and, because $28 < 476$, it is placed as the left child of $476$.
\end{minipage}

To begin writing an insertion method for our \li{BinarySearchTree} class, we consider BST's themselves.
BSTs are a recursive data structure because each of the left and right subtrees of a parent node are, themselves, BSTs.
Therefore, many of the algorithms for working with binary search trees can also be recursive.
A recursive function is a function that calls itself until it reaches a base case. 
In the case of a BST, the recursive function allows us to travel right or left as appropriate until we reach a missing subtree.
To supplement our \li{insert} method, we will write a recursive function to call within our insert function:
\begin{lstlisting}
def insert(self, data):
    def _recur_insert(node, item):
        # This is the base case; we have reached the proper node for insertion
        # and we now return the data as a Node to the previous function call,
        # setting it as the right or left node of its parent.
        if node is None:
            return Node(item)
        else:
            # Recursively travel through the tree until you reach a leaf node
            if data < node.value:
                node.left = _recur_insert(node.left, item)
            elif data > node.value:
                node.right = _recur_insert(node.right, item)
                
        # After the base case, each of the previous calls to the
        # recursive function finishes by returning the previous node.
        return node
        
    self.root = _recur_insert(self.root, data)
    self.size += 1
\end{lstlisting}
We call this recursive function and set it equal to the root node.
The function will continually call itself until it finds an empty node. 
It inserts the data as a node, and then \li{return node} will finish each of the previous calls to the recursive function. 
(It simply returns each of the parents it recursively visited prior, re-setting them equal to themselves, until it finally returns to \li{self.root}.)
Finally, we finish our insertion method by updating our size.

\subsection*{Searching}
Although recursive functions are often useful and intuitive with trees, we are by no means required to use them.
In fact, for large trees, a recursive algorithm may incur a large overhead.
When writing a method to search for nodes in a BST, we may either use recursion or an alternate method to ascertain whether a piece of data is to be found within the tree.

\begin{problem}
Add a method for finding nodes to your binary tree class. If a node containing your data exists within the tree, return the node.
If no such node exists, return \li{False}.
\label{prob:Finding Nodes}
\end{problem}

\subsection*{Removing}
Removing nodes is only slightly more complicated.
We have three cases to consider:
\begin{enumerate}
\item No children.
This is the most straightforward case.
If the node we want to delete has no children then we simply remove the node.
\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{0.3\textwidth}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[
      level distance=1.5 cm,
      level 1/.style={sibling distance=3cm},
      level 2/.style={sibling distance=1.5cm},
      thick, minimum size=1cm]
      \node[circle,draw](23) {23}
	    child {
	    node [circle,draw](17){17}
	    }
	    child{node[circle,draw](476){476}
	    	child{node[circle,draw=red, fill=red!20!](28){28}}
	    	child[fill=none] {edge from parent[draw=none]}
	    };
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{0.2\textwidth}
   \begin{center}
     \begin{tikzpicture}[]
        \draw[->, double, double equal sign distance, -implies, thick] (0,0) -- (1.25,0);
    \end{tikzpicture}
   \end{center}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{0.3\textwidth}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[
      level distance=1.5 cm,
      level 1/.style={sibling distance=3cm},
      level 2/.style={sibling distance=1.5cm},
      thick, minimum size=1cm]
      \node[circle,draw](23) {23}
	    child {
	    node [circle,draw](17){17}
	    }
	    child{node[circle,draw](476){476}
	    };
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}

\item One child.
In this case, we have to worry about children.
If we were to just delete the node, we would lose the entire subtree.
The solution, however, is simple enough: we promote the single child to take the place of the node we are deleting.
This preserves the binary search property.
\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{0.3\textwidth}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[
      level distance=1.5 cm,
      level 1/.style={sibling distance=3cm},
      level 2/.style={sibling distance=1.5cm},
      thick, minimum size=1cm]
      \node[circle,draw](23) {23}
	    child {
	    node [circle,draw](17){17}
	    }
	    child{node[circle,draw=red, fill = red!20!](476){476}
	    	child{node[circle,draw](28){28}}
	    	child[fill=none] {edge from parent[draw=none]}
	    };
     \path[->, >=stealth', shorten >=1pt, auto]
      (28) edge[bend left, red] (476);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{0.2\textwidth}
   \begin{center}
     \begin{tikzpicture}[]
        \draw[->, double, double equal sign distance, -implies, thick] (0,0) -- (1.25,0);
    \end{tikzpicture}
   \end{center}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{0.3\textwidth}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[
      level distance=1.5 cm,
      level 1/.style={sibling distance=3cm},
      level 2/.style={sibling distance=1.5cm},
      thick, minimum size=1cm]
      \node[circle,draw](23) {23}
	    child {
	    node [circle,draw](17){17}
	    }
	    child{node[circle,draw](28){28}
	    };
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}
\item Two children.
We need to be a little careful in this case.
We can't simply promote a child node.
Indeed, how would we decide which child to promote?
Fortunately, we can reduce this case down to one of the previous two cases.
Suppose we are removing node $23$, which has two children.
We first locate either the smallest node of the right subtree or the greatest node of the left subtree.
In this case, we identify node $28$ as the smallest node in the right subtree.
Because $28$ is the smallest node of the right subtree, it cannot have a child to its left, which implies it either has one child to the right or no children at all.
We swap the data of nodes $28$ and $23$ (so node $28$ now has the data that $23$ had and vice versa).
This swap still preserves the binary search property of the tree and removing $23$ has been reduced to a simpler case.
\begin{minipage}{0.3\textwidth}
\begin{tikzpicture}[
  level distance=1.5 cm,
  level 1/.style={sibling distance=3cm},
  level 2/.style={sibling distance=1.5cm},

	child {
	node [circle,draw]{17}
	}

		child{node[circle,draw](28){28}}
		child[fill=none] {edge from parent[draw=none]}
	};	
  \path[->, >=stealth', auto]
     (23) edge[out = 5, in=15, blue, looseness=1.5] (28)
     (28) edge[bend left, red] (23);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{minipage}

\end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}
Give your binary tree class a method for removing nodes.
Make sure to account for each of the three cases presented above.

\emph{Helpful Hint}: It may be a good idea to write a recursive function to call within your remove method. 
\label{prob:Binary Removal}
\end{problem}

If data we put in a binary search tree is ordered, we lose the efficiency advantage of these trees.
We can use a balanced binary search tree to avoid this issue and retain the efficiency of binary search trees for any kind of data.

\section*{Hash Tables}
A \emph{hash table} is a very simple data structure that trades memory space for speed.
The key advantage of a hash table is this speed; most of the operations of a hash table execute very efficiently, independent of its size.
As such, hash tables have very fast lookup times; they form the underlying structure of Python's sets and dictionaries.

One of the key components of a hash table is a \emph{hash function}.
A hash function takes a piece data as an input and outputs a natural number which corresponds to the index for that piece of data.
Since the hash function must be executed to perform any operation on the hash table (e.g. insertion or lookup), it is imperative that the hash function execute quickly.
Thus, the heart of a hash table is a good hash function.

We begin defining our \li{HashTable} class, then, by allocating space within a one-dimensional array (in this case, a Python list) and by taking both the array size and the hash function as arguments.
\begin{lstlisting}
class HashTable(object):
    def __init__(self, capacity, hashfunc):
        # Efficiently extends a list to the designated hash table size.
        self.hashtable = [None] * hsize
        
        # Keeps track of the number of elements within the hash table.
        self.size = 0
        
        # Indicates the size of the hash table
        self.capacity = hsize
        
        # Indicates the hash function
        self._hash = hashfunc
\end{lstlisting}

What makes a good hash function?
A good hash function will execute quickly, but it is equally important for it to distribute items evenly throughout the hash table. 
Since we usually mod by the table size at the end (to keep the index within proper range), we need to make sure the remainders mod $n$ are evenly distributed.
Consider a simple example where we use a hash table to store strings.
Our hash function will index a string by the string's length mod the size of the table.
As the size of such a hash table grows, however, fewer and fewer strings will be hashed to its end: the function won't distribute the data evenly.
Therefore, before we mod the string length by the table size, we multiply by a large prime number.
A large number helps guarantee that the remainders will vary, and the prime helps prevent us from multiplying by a multiple of the table size (which would send us to $0$ every time).
\begin{lstlisting}
def HashFunction(string, tablesize, prime=5417):
    index = (len(string) * prime)  %  tablesize
    return index
\end{lstlisting}
Let's apply our example hash function to a table of size 4.
Then `cat' would be stored at index $3$ and `lion' would be stored at index $0$.
\begin{figure}
\begin{tikzpicture}[thick]
\tikzstyle{block} = [rectangle, draw, minimum height = .55cm, minimum width = 1.5cm]
    \node[block] (0) [] {`lion'};
    \node[block] (1) [right=-.03 cm of 0] {}; % The -.03 ensures that our table lines intersect, rather than combine to create thicker lines.
    \node[block] (2) [right=-.03 cm of 1] {};
    \node[block] (3) [right=-.03 cm of 2] {`cat'};
\tikzstyle{block} = [draw=none]
\foreach \s in {0, 1, 2, 3}{
    \node[block] [above=0cm of \s]{\s};}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}
\begin{problem}
Add an insert method to your \li{HashTable} class. Don't forget to update your counter for the number of elements within the hashtable!

Initialize a hash table of size 11 using the example \li{HashFunction()} given above.
Add the following felines: `lion', `tiger', `cheetah', `cougar', `colocolo', and `cat'.
Print your hash table. What happens when you insert `clouded leopard'?
What happens when you insert `jaguar'? (Consider all the attributes of the hash table, not just the elements themselves).
\emph{Helpful Hint:} Keep in mind the various methods of \li{self}; for example, to access indices of our hashtable, we use \li{self.hashtable[index]}.
\label{Prob:Basic hash insert}
\end{problem}

As we saw in the previous problem, our example hash function is still far from perfect.
In our example hash table, if we try to store the string `leopard', our hash function sends it to 3.
But `cat' is already stored in spot 3!
This is called a \emph{hash collision}.
How do we deal with hash collisions?
\begin{figure}
\begin{tikzpicture}[->,>=stealth',shorten >=1pt, auto,thick]
\tikzstyle{block} = [rectangle, draw, minimum height = .55cm, minimum width = 1.5cm]
   \node[block] (0) [] {`lion'};
   \node[block] (1) [right=-.03 cm of 0] {};
   \node[block] (2) [right=-.03 cm of 1] {};
   \node[block] (3) [right=-.03 cm of 2] {`cat'};
\tikzstyle{block} = [draw=none]
\foreach \s in {0, 1, 2, 3}{
    \node[block] [above=0cm of \s]{\s};}
   \node[block, node distance = 1.5cm, red] (leopard) [below right of=3]{`leopard'};
   \path[red]
   (leopard.west) edge[bend left] (3.south);
   \node[draw = none, node distance = 1.75cm] [left of=0]{};  % Centralize this particular figure
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}

The ideal hash function maps unique inputs to unique outputs that are uniformly distributed over the hash space.
However, it is extremely difficult to create an ideal hash function; most hash functions will experience hash collisions.
Fortunately, there are ways to handle hash collisions.
The two methods that we will discuss are called open addressing and chaining.

\subsection*{Open Addressing}
The term \emph{open addressing} indicates that the output of the hash function doesn't necessarily identify the location of the piece of data.
\emph{Probing} is one of the more popular forms of open addressing; in this section we will discuss both linear and quadratic probing.

In the event of a hash collision, linear probing seeks to resolve the collision by looking for the next available location in the hash table.
We can do this by sequentially visiting each location and, when we find an empty one, storing our data in that location.
The following is an example of a linear probing hash function where $n$ is the size of the hash table, $h(x)$ is the hash function, and $i$ is a constant:
\begin{equation*}
h(x, i) = h(x) + i \pmod{n}
\end{equation*}

We start with $i = 0$, and if the spot is full, we increment $i$ until we find an empty spot.
If we go back to our earlier example, we can store `leopard' in our hash table using linear probing.
Our hash function sends us to spot 3, but it is already filled, so we start stepping through the table.
Since 3 is at the end of the table, we go to the beginning (namely $4 \% 4$) and, because spot 0 is already filled, we proceed to index 1.
Spot 1 is empty, so we store `leopard' there.
\begin{figure}
  \begin{tikzpicture}[->,>=stealth',shorten >=1pt, auto, thick]
 \tikzstyle{block} = [rectangle, draw, minimum height = .55cm, minimum width = 1.5cm]
   \node[block] (0) [] {`lion'};
   \node[block] (1) [right=-.03 cm of 0] {`leopard'};
   \node[block] (2) [right=-.03 cm of 1] {};
   \node[block] (3) [right=-.03 cm of 2] {`cat'};
\tikzstyle{block} = [draw=none]
\foreach \s in {0, 1, 2, 3}{
    \node[block] [above=0cm of \s]{\s};}
   \node[block, node distance = 1.5cm, red] (leopard) [below right of=3]{`leopard'};
   \path[red]
   (leopard.west) edge[bend left] (3.south)
   (3.south) edge[bend left] (0.south)
   (0.south) edge[bend right, out=-20, shorten <=.2cm] (1.south);
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}
\begin{problem}
Expand the \li{insert} method of your \li{HashTable} class to enable linear probing.
Do not allow your method to insert, however, if the hash table is full.
From your previous hash table, again add `clouded leopard' and `jaguar'.
Which index does your new insert method send `clouded leopard' to?
What about `jaguar'?
\label{prob:Linear probing insert}
\end{problem}

When we use linear probing to insert a piece of data, how can we later find it?
If we simply use our hash function, we will be directed to the incorrect index.
We then have to begin iterating through the table to search for our data.
Let's supplement our \li{HashTable} class with a \li{find} method.
\begin{lstlisting}
def find(self, data):
    index = self._hash(data, self.hsize)
    # Steps through the table until it reaches either the data or 
    # the initial index.
    for i in xrange(self.hsize):
        newindex = (index + i) % self.hsize
        # Optional step: prints the indices each step of the search.
        print 'Searching ' + str(newindex)
        if self.hashtable[newindex] == data:
            return True
    return False
\end{lstlisting}

Though linear probing is certainly a valid method to resolve hash collisions, it has its own set of drawbacks.
For example, a linear probe tends to cause elements in the table to cluster together.
Furthermore, if our hash table is densely populated or our hash function has a lot of collisions, we lose the efficiency of a hash table because we must resort to a linear search.
Quadratic probing seeks to mitigate the issues associated with linear probing by spreading out hash collisions more evenly.
A quadratic probing hash function with constants $c_1$ and $c_2$ is of the form
\begin{equation*}
h(x, i) = h(x) + c_1i + c_2i^2 \pmod{n}.
\end{equation*}
When we experience a hash collision or search for data, we increment $i$ and use $h(x,i)$ to step through the table until we find an empty spot or the desired piece of data, respectively.

\subsection*{Chaining}
Chaining is a form of \emph{closed addressing}, meaning that the output of the hash function actually does point to the location of the data.
With chaining, each location of the hash table references a list of the data pieces sent to that index.
When one or more pieces of information hash to the same location, they are simply appended to that location's list.

Let's add `leopard' to our earlier example, this time using chaining.
Our hash function sends us to 3, but `cat' is already there.
Thus we add `leopard' to the list in spot 3 that already contains `cat'.
\begin{figure}
\begin{tikzpicture}[->,>=stealth',shorten >=1pt, auto, thick]
 \tikzstyle{block} = [rectangle, draw, minimum height = .55cm, minimum width = 1.5cm]
    \node[block] (0) [] {`lion'};
    \node[block] (1) [right=-.03 cm of 0] {};
    \node[block] (2) [right=-.03 cm of 1] {};
    \node[block] (3) [right=-.03 cm of 2] {`cat'};
    \node[block, node distance = 1.5cm](leopard)[below of=3]{`leopard'};
\tikzstyle{block} = [draw=none]
\foreach \s in {0, 1, 2, 3}{
    \node[block] [above=0cm of \s]{\s};}
   \draw[->] (3) -- (leopard);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}

\begin{problem}
Improve your \li{insert} method to deal with hash collisions via chaining, rather than probing. 
Note that, with this method, you need not return an error if the hash table is already full (the new insertion will simply be appended to the proper index's list). Keep in mind that when we use chaining to deal with hash collisions, the indices of our hash table are associated with lists, not strings.
Recreate and print your feline hash table(including 'jaguar' and 'clouded leopard') using this new method of insertion. 
\label{prob:Chaining insert}
\end{problem}

With a good hash function, the average size of the hash location's list is relatively short, so searching the list doesn't affect the overall performance of the hash table.
We update our \li{find} method to search a hash table implemented via chaining:
\begin{lstlisting}
def find(self, data):
    index = self._hash(data, self.hsize)
    for i in self.hashtable[index]:
        if i == data:
            return True
    return False
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection*{Hash Table Details}
As a hash table fills up, its performance degrades.
This is because more hash collisions occur, forcing us to use either linear probing or chaining to resolve them.
As a result, we have to search through lists or iterate through the table more often.
To combat this, we often track a \emph{load factor} for the hash table.
This load factor reveals how `saturated' the table is by calculating the ratio of the number of elements in the hash table to the size of the hash table.
We can easily add method to calculate the load factor of our \li{HashTable} class:
\begin{lstlisting}
def load(self):
    loadfactor = float(self.elsize)/self.hsize
    return loadfactor
\end{lstlisting}

When the load factor exceeds a certain threshold, we must allocate more space for the table.
However, since the hash function was dependant on the size of the table, we need to re-hash everything already in the table.
This can sometimes be a very expensive operation.
It's important to avoid resizing the table whenever possible.

After adding `leopard' into our earlier example, our hash table is very full. Let's re-hash it into a table with size 8.
Our new hash function sends a string to its size mod 8 (rather than mod 4, as before).
`cat' is sent to 3, `lion' to 4, and `leopard' to 7.
Now that we have no hash collisions, there are no lists to iterate through and our hash table performs far more efficiently.
\begin{figure}
\begin{tikzpicture}[->,>=stealth',shorten >=1pt, auto, thick]
 \tikzstyle{block} = [rectangle, draw, minimum height = .55cm, minimum width = 1.5cm]
    \node[block] (0) [] {};
\foreach \s/\t/\u in {1/0/ , 2/1/ , 3/2/ , 4/3/`cat', 5/4/`lion', 6/5/ , 7/6/`leopard'}{
    \node[block] (\s) [right=-.03 of \t] {\u};}
\tikzstyle{block} = [draw=none]
\foreach \s in {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}{
    \node[block] [above=0cm of \s]{\s};}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}

\begin{problem}
Create a method for your (closed addressing) hash table to resize.
Implement this method such that, if the load factor exceeds $.75$, it will resize the hash table so that the load factor will be below $.33$.
Don't forget to rehash the elements already within the table. 
Call this resize method at the end of your insertion method, so that it never inserts into a saturated table.
Now, insert `siberian tiger' and `bengal tiger' into your feline hash table. What is its new size? 
\label{prob:Hash resizing}
\end{problem}

\section*{Sparse Matrices}
Matrices are powerful tools, but they can take a lot of space in memory.
A $n \times n$ matrix takes $n^2$ places of storage!
If every entry in the matrix is useful information this is fine, but if the matrix is filled with a lot of zeros, that means we are using almost $n^2$ spots in memory to store useless zeros.
Not only does this unnecessarily take up space, it means that during computation we will spend a lot of time adding and multiplying zeros.
That can be a lot of useless computation.
The solution to this is \emph{sparse matrices}.
They are other data structures used to represent a matrix by only storing non-zero entries.

One common way is a dictionary.
The index of the spot in the matrix is the key and the number in that spot is the value.
For example,
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
22 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 5 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -4
\end{pmatrix}
\]
would be stored as
\[
\begin{tabular}{|c|l|}
\hline
Key & Value \\
\hline
(1,0) & 22 \\
\hline
(3,2) & 5 \\
\hline
(4,4) & -4 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\].

In this case, we stored a 5 by 5 matrix in a dictionary with only 3 key-value pairs.

SciPy has a nice implementation of sparse matrices.
Not only does SciPy reduce the amount of space needed to store matrices, it has fast algorithms for matrix operations that takes advantage of the fact that there are so many zeros.

\begin{problem}
Use your time function from Section 1 and the code given below to time matrix multiplication using sparse matrices versus normal matrix multiplication for $ n = 100, 500, 1000, 1500,$ and $2000$. Which is faster? What happens as the matrices grow larger?
\begin{lstlisting}
from scipy import sparse
import numpy as np

#dimension of matrices
n = 100

# create 2 random sparse matrices with density 0.1
A = sparse.rand(n,n)
B = sparse.rand(n,n)

#Multiply using sparse matrix techniques
A.dot(B)

#Change to dense matrices
A_dense = A.todense()
B_dense = B.todense()

#Multiply with normal matrix multiplication
A_dense.dot(B_dense)

 \end{lstlisting}
 \label{prob:Sparse}
 \end{problem}
