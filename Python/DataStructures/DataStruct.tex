\section*{Introduction}

Analyzing and manipulating data are essential skills in scientific computing.
Storing, retrieving, and manipulating data take time.
As a dataset grows, so does the amount of time it takes to access and manipulate it.
The structure of how the data are stored determines how efficiently the data may be processed.

In this lab we will begin to study data structures.
Data structures are specialized objects for organizing data.
There are many kinds of data structures, each with specific strengths and weaknesses.
For example, some data structures take a long time to build, but once built their data are quickly accessible.
Others are built quickly, but are not as efficiently accessible.
Different applications require different structures for optimal performance.

\section*{Nodes}

Recall that some built-in data types for Python are booleans, strings, floats, and integers.
Most data in applications take one of these forms.
However, as the size of a dataset increases, these types prove inefficient.
Many data structures use \emph{nodes} to overcome these inefficiencies.

Think of data as several types of objects that need to be stored in a warehouse.
Then a node would be a standard size box that can hold all the different types of objects.
For example, suppose the warehouse needs to store lamps of various sizes.
Rather than trying to stack lamps of different shapes on top of each other efficiently, it is preferable to put them in the boxes of standard size.
Then adding new boxes and retrieving stored ones becomes much easier.
This analogy extends to data structures.

A \li{Node} class is usually simple.
In Python, the data in the Node is stored as an attribute.
Other attributes may be added (or inherited) specific to a particular data structure.
The data structure links the nodes together in a way that is efficient for its particular application.

\begin{lstlisting}
# Node.py

class Node(object):
	"""A Node class for storing data."""
	def __init__(self, data):
		"""Construct a new node that stores some data."""
		self.data = data
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}
# Import the Node class from Node.py
>>> from Node import Node

# Create some nodes.  Note that any data type may be stored.
>>> int_node = Node(1)
>>> str_node = Node('abc')
>>> lis_node = Node([1,'abc'])

# Access a node's data.
>>> lis_node.data
[1, 'abc']
\end{lstlisting}

% Alternative first problem (baby problem with Node class)
\begin{problem}
Add extra functionality to the \li{Node} class by implementing the \li{__str__} magic method so that it returns a string representation of its data.
Also implement the \li{__lt__}, \li{__le__}, \li{__eq__}, \li{__gt__}, and \li{__ge__} comparison magic methods so that the data stored inside of two Nodes is compared.
For example, a Node \li{x} is less than a Node \li{y} if and only if the data contained in \li{x} is less than the data contained in \li{y}.
\end{problem}

% Old first problem.
\begin{comment}
\begin{problem}
Add a new class to \li{Node.py} called \li{StrNode} that only accepts strings as data.
Use inheritance and call the \li{Node} class constructor in the constructor for \li{StrNode}
(Hint: Use the \li{type} built-in function).

Implement the \li{__str__} magic method in the \li{Node} class so that it returns a string representation of its data.
\end{problem}

\section*{Linked Lists}

A linked list is a data type that chains nodes together.
Each node instance in a linked list stores a reference to the next link in the chain.
A linked list class also stores a reference to the first node in the chain, called the \li{head}.
See Figure \ref{fig:singly_linked}.

\begin{figure}

\begin{tikzpicture}[->,>=stealth',shorten >=1pt,auto, node distance=1.5cm,thick,main node/.style={rectangle,draw}, minimum size=.5cm]

    \path[draw](\s) edge[shorten <=.1cm](\t);}
  \draw[black!20!blue] (H) edge (1.north);
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Singly-linked List}
\label{fig:singly_linked}
\end{figure}

\begin{lstlisting}
# Node.py

class LinkedListNode(Node):
	"""A Node class for linked lists. Inherits from the 'Node' class.
	Contains a reference to the next node in the list.
	"""
	def __init__(self, data):
		"""Construct a Node and add an attribute for the next node in the list.
		"""
		Node.__init__(self, data)
		self.next = None
\end{lstlisting}

A basic implementation of a linked list will have a constructor and a method for adding new nodes to the end of the list.
To get to the end of the list, start at the \li{head} of the list.
Then traverse the list by going from node to node until the end is reached.
Then, set the \li{next} attribute of the last node to be the new node.
This is done in the following class.
See Figure \ref{fig:add} for an illustration.

\begin{lstlisting}
# spec.py

from Node import LinkedListNode as Node

class LinkedList(object):
    """Singly-linked list data structure class. The first node in the list is
    referenced to by 'head'.
	"""
	
	def __init__(self):
		"""Creates a new linked list. Create the head attribute and set it 
		to 'None' since the list is empty.
		"""
		self.head = None

	def add(self, data):
		"""Create a new Node containing 'data' and add it to the end of
		the list.
		"""

		new_node = Node(data)
		if self.head is None:
			# If the list is empty, point the head attribute to the new node.
			self.head = new_node
		else:
			# If the list is not empty, traverse the list and place the
			# new_node at the end.
			current_node = self.head
			while current_node.next is not None:
				# This moves the current node to the next node if it is
				# not empty. Thus when we break out of the loop, current_node
				# points to the last node in the list.
				current_node = current_node.next

			current_node.next = new_node
\end{lstlisting}

\end{figure}

% Problem 2: __str__ for the LinkedList class.
\begin{problem}
Write the \li{__str__} method for the \li{LinkedList} class so that when a \li{LinkedList} instance is printed, its output matches that of a Python list.
\end{problem}

In addition to adding new nodes to the end of a list, it is also useful to remove nodes and insert new nodes at specified locations.
To delete a node, all references to the node must be removed.
Then Python will automatically delete the object, since there is no way for the user to access it.
Na{\"i}vely, this might be done by finding the previous node to the one being removed, and setting its \li{next} attribute to none.

\begin{lstlisting}
# A naive node removal - Does not work.

def remove(self, data):
	"""Remove the Node containing 'data'."""

	# Find the node whose next node contains data
	current_node = self.head
	while current_node.next.data != data:
		current_node = current_node.next

	# Remove the next reference to the target node.
	current_node.next = None
\end{lstlisting}

Since the only reference to the node that is deleted is the previous node's next attribute, this will delete the node.
However, since the only reference to the next node came from the deleted node, it also will deleted.
This will continue to the end of the list.
Thus, deleting one node in this manner deletes the remainder of the list.
This can be remedied by pointing the previous node's next attribute to the node after the deleted node.
Then there will be no reference to the removed node and it will be deleted. 
See Figure \ref{fig:remove} for an illustration.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\caption{Include two pictures of the \li{remove} method: the na{\"i}ve method that doesn't work, and the true method that does. Describe them.}
\label{fig:remove}
\end{figure}


\begin{lstlisting}
# A node removal that works

def remove(self, data):
	"""Remove the Node containing 'data'."""

	# First, check if the head is the node to be removed. If so, set the
	# head to be the node after head. This removes the only reference to
	# head, so it is then deleted.
	if self.head.data == data:
		self.head = self.head.next
	else:
		current_node = self.head
		# Move current_node through the list until it points to the node that
		# precedes the target node.
		while current_node.next.data != data:
			current_node = current_node.next
	
		# Point the current node to the node after the target node.
		new_next_node = current_node.next.next
		current_node.next = new_next_node
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{warn}
In some other programming languages, leaving a reference to an object without explicitly deleting it can cause serious memory leaks.
In these languages, even though the object is not accessible to the user, it still occupies space in memory, often leading to an overflow.
In Python if there is no reference to an object, and thus no way for the programmer to access it, the object is automatically deleted and the space in memory is freed up.
\end{warn}

\begin{problem}
Though the above code works to remove specified nodes, it is not quite complete.
Modify the \li{remove} method so that if the user tries to remove a node containing \li{value} that is not in the list, the method prints ``\li{value} not in list.''
\end{problem}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\caption{Include a picture of the \li{insert} method and describe it.}
\label{fig:insert}
\end{figure}

\begin{problem}
Inserting a node at a specified location is similar to removing a node.
Add an \li{insert} method to the \li{LinkedList} class that inserts a new node before the first node that contains the data specified by the user.
This function accepts two arguments: the data for the new node, and the data of the node before which the new node will be inserted.

See Figure \ref{fig:insert} for an illustration of the \li{insert} method.
Note that since \li{insert} inserts a node before a specified node, it is not possible to \li{insert} at the end of the list.
\end{problem}

\section*{Doubly-Linked Lists}

A doubly-linked list is a linked list where each node keeps track the node that precedes it as well as the node that follows.
The end of the list is also typically kept track of with a \li{tail} attribute.
See Figure \ref{fig:doubly_linked} for an illustration.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\caption{Illustrate a doubly-linked list.}
\label{fig:doubly_linked}
\end{figure}

\begin{lstlisting}
# location: Node.py

class DoublyLinkedListNode(Node):
	"""A node for a doubly-linked list."""
	def __init__(self, data):
		"""Set prev and next attributes."""
		Node.__init__(self, data)
		self.prev = None
		self.next = None
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\caption{Illustrate insertion for doubly-linked lists.}
\label{fig:d_insertion}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\caption{Illustrate removal for doubly-linked lists.}
\label{fig:d_removal}
\end{figure}


All of the methods for linked lists can be implemented for doubly-linked lists.
See Figures \ref{fig:d_insertion} and \ref{fig:d_removal} for illustrations of the insert and remove methods.

\begin{problem}
Implement a \li{DoublyLinkedList} class that inherits from the \li{LinkedList} class, but uses \li{DoublyLinkedListNode} instances to build the list.
Add an attribute called \li{tail} that keeps track of the node at the end of the list.
Overwrite the \li{add}, \li{remove}, and \li{insert} methods.
Use the \li{tail} attribute to make the \li{add} method more efficient.
\end{problem}

% TODO: change the class hierarchy (?) What do we do with StrNode?
\begin{problem}
Implement a sorted linked list.
This data structure adds new nodes strategically so that the data is always kept in order.
Inherit this class from \li{DoublyLinkedList}, and override the \li{add} and \li{insert} methods.
%Inherit the node class for this data structure from \li{StrNode}, and modify it so that it is compatible with doubly-linked lists.
When a new node is added, traverse the list until the data in the next node is greater than or equal to the data for the new node.
Then insert the new node so that the ordering is maintained.
Also override the \li{insert} method so that it receives only one argument and calls \li{add}. This effectively disables \li{insert} and prevents the user from accidentally inserting a node in a location that would disrupt the ordering.

To test this data structure, import the provided \li{WordList} module.
This includes a method called \li{create_word_list} that returns a list of randomly ordered words, extracted from a text file.
The file \li{English.txt} contains a list of over $58,000$ English words.
Write a function called \li{sort} that sorts the list of words generated by \li{create_word_list("English.txt")} by adding them to a \li{SortedLinkedList} object.
Then return the object.
(Warning: sorting the entire data set can take about 15 minutes. Test your data structure on smaller data sets first.)
\end{problem}

Python has many quick sorting methods.
Even on the seemingly large data set of over 58,000 words used in the preceding problem, the \li{sort} method for Python lists is almost instantaneous.
In the next lab we will focus \emph{Trees}, special kinds of linked lists that allow for much quicker sorting and data retrieval.
